// on; these two flags cost nothing and make any new warning readable where it
// happened. The build is warning-free as of this commit.
//
// Deliberately not -Xlint: it finds another hundred things in code that already
// works, which is a separate piece of work from keeping the build quiet.
// -release pins the JDK API this compiles against to the one the image ships
// (`dockerBaseImage` below), which matters because a developer may build on any
// JDK they happen to have. Without it, calling a method newer than the runtime
// compiles clean locally and fails on the deploy box, which is the worst
// possible place to find out. With it, the local build fails immediately and
// says which method. Keep this and `dockerBaseImage` on the same number.

// Pekko 1.7 reaches for `sun.misc.Unsafe`, which JDK 24 marked terminally
// deprecated, so every start prints four WARNING lines before any of our own
// logging. They come from the JVM on stderr rather than through logback, so they
// reach `docker logs` and stop there — the dashboard never sees them.
//
// Do not go looking at the class the warning names. It reports whichever call
// lands first, which is `org.apache.pekko.util.Unsafe` reading a field offset off
// `String.value` to run a hash fast-path — the harmless one. What would actually
// kill the bot is `pekko.dispatch.AbstractNodeQueue`, whose lock-free mailbox
// queues are built on compareAndSwap: run with
// `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=deny` and it fails in that class's static
// initialiser while ActorSystem is being constructed, i.e. at BotApp.scala's
// first line of work, with nothing started.
//
// Not urgent, and not silenced. Both JDK 25 and JDK 26 default to `warn` (checked
// against the shipped 26 binary, which contradicts the widely repeated claim that
// 26 throws), so nothing flips under us while this image pins its own JDK — and
// `--sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow` is a one-line reprieve if a later JDK
// does deny by default before the real fix is available. It stays visible because
// a suppressed warning is one nobody acts on.
//
// The real fix is verified, not hoped for: Pekko moved these 21 classes to
// VarHandle, and `pekko 2.0.0-M4` + `pekko-http 2.0.0-M1` builds this project
// with ZERO source changes, passes all 1828 tests warning-free, and starts
// cleanly under `=deny`. It is not taken yet only because pekko-http's 2.x line
// has sat at its first milestone since Jan 2026 while core reached M4 — and
// pekko-http is this bot's hot path. When 2.0.0 goes final this is a two-line
// version bump; re-run the suite and drop this comment.

// The sprite cache's directory has to exist in the image, owned by the user the

//
// sbt-native-packager runs the app as uid 1001 and leaves /opt/docker owned by
// root with no group write, so the app cannot create a directory there at all.
// Worse, a named volume mounted at a path the image does not have gets its
// mountpoint created by Docker as root — which is what happened here: the
// volume existed, the directory existed, and every write into it was denied.
// Docker copies the image directory's ownership into an empty named volume, so
// creating it here with the right owner fixes both the volume case and the
// no-volume case.
//
// Keyed on the USER line native-packager emits. If that ever changes shape this
// silently stops applying, which is why CreatureSpriteCache also checks the
// directory is writable at startup and says so plainly rather than failing one
// sprite at a time.
