/** Ties ongoing bot activity to a Patreon subscription via seats: each supporter
 *  gets `seatLimit` of them (adjustable per user via [[effectiveSeatLimit]]), and
 *  `/setup` assigns one to a (guild, world) pair — see
 *  [[com.tibiabot.setup.ChannelService]]. A positive seat adjustment also bypasses
 *  the subscription check entirely (see [[callerIsSubscribed]]), so the
 *  dashboard's "grant extra seats" doubles as a full paywall override.
 *
 *  Subscription status is Patreon's answer, read from the synced snapshot in
 *  `PatreonMemberRepository`. The support guild is consulted only to resolve a
 *  *username* to a Discord id (see [[resolveUserId]]), as a convenience — a raw id
 *  or mention bypasses it.
 *
 *  Nothing is cut off the moment it stops checking out. A world whose seat owner
 *  has lapsed — or that was never seated at all — starts a `graceDays` timer kept
 *  in `PatreonGraceRepository`, and runs untouched until it expires. Resolving the
 *  subscription first stops the clock. See `applyRefresh`, whose one rule puts an
 *  orphaned setup and a cancelled one on identical footing.
 *
 *  All of it steps aside where Patreon was never set up (see
 *  `patreonNotConfigured`), which is what makes the bot self-hostable. */
